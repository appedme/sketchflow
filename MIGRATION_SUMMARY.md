# 🎯 Database Migration Summary

## What I Created

I've created a **safe, temporary API endpoint** that will add the organization and team tables to your Turso database **WITHOUT deleting any existing data**.

### Files Created:

1. ✅ **`src/app/api/migrate/route.ts`** - The migration API endpoint
   - POST `/api/migrate` - Runs the migration
   - GET `/api/migrate` - Checks migration status

2. ✅ **`scripts/migrate-db.js`** - Node.js migration runner with pretty output

3. ✅ **`scripts/migrate.sh`** - Bash script for easy execution

4. ✅ **`MIGRATION_README.md`** - Complete documentation

5. ✅ **`MIGRATION_QUICKSTART.md`** - Quick reference guide

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Start Your Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Run the Migration (Choose One)

**Option A: Bash Script (Easiest)**
```bash
./scripts/migrate.sh
```

**Option B: Node Script**
```bash
node scripts/migrate-db.js
```

**Option C: cURL**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/migrate \
  -H "x-migration-secret: dev-only-secret"
```

### Step 3: Verify Success
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/migrate
```

Should show `"allTablesExist": true`

## 🔒 Safety Guarantees

✅ **Never deletes anything** - Only creates tables and adds columns  
✅ **Idempotent** - Safe to run multiple times  
✅ **Checks before adding** - Won't fail if tables/columns exist  
✅ **Detailed reporting** - Shows exactly what happened  
✅ **Try-catch wrapped** - Each operation is protected  

## 📦 What Gets Added

### New Tables (5):
1. `organizations` - Workspaces/companies
2. `organization_members` - Users in organizations with roles
3. `teams` - Teams within organizations
4. `team_members` - Users in teams
5. `organization_invitations` - Pending member invitations

### Modified Tables (1):
- `projects` gets 2 new columns:
  - `organization_id` - Links to organization
  - `team_id` - Links to team

### Performance Indexes (9):
- Foreign key indexes for fast queries

## 📊 Expected Output

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "summary": {
    "total": 16,
    "success": 16,
    "errors": 0,
    "skipped": 0
  },
  "message": "✅ Migration completed successfully!",
  "warning": "🗑️ REMEMBER TO DELETE /src/app/api/migrate/route.ts"
}
```

## 🧹 Cleanup After Success

```bash
rm src/app/api/migrate/route.ts
rm scripts/migrate-db.js
rm scripts/migrate.sh
rm MIGRATION_README.md
rm MIGRATION_QUICKSTART.md
rm MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md
```

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. ✅ Test organizations at: http://localhost:3000/organizations
2. ✅ Integrate authentication (replace `x-user-id` headers)
3. ✅ Add email notifications for invitations
4. ✅ Deploy to production

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Cannot connect to database" | Check `.env.local` has TURSO_DATABASE_URL and TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN |
| "Table already exists" | This is fine! Skip is normal for existing tables |
| "Column already exists" | This is fine! The column was already added |
| Dev server not running | Run `npm run dev` first |

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Run `GET /api/migrate` first to see current status
- The migration is safe to run multiple times
- You can stop and resume - it won't break anything
- Check the detailed results array to see what was skipped vs created
