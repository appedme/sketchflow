Got it 🚀 I’ll draft a **long, detailed `BEST_PRACTICES.md`** that you can directly add to your repo. It will cover **folder structure, coding style, reusability, performance, and scaling**.

Here’s the file:

# 📘 Best Development Practices

This document outlines the **best practices** for maintaining a clean, scalable, and maintainable codebase. All contributors should follow these guidelines to ensure consistency and long-term project health.

---

## 1. 📂 Project & Folder Structure

### ✅ Organize by Feature, Not Type

Instead of dumping 20–30 files into one folder, group related files by **feature or domain**.
**Example:**

```
src/
  components/
    auth/
      LoginForm.tsx
      SignupForm.tsx
      index.ts
    dashboard/
      Sidebar.tsx
      DashboardHeader.tsx
      index.ts
  pages/
    blog/
      index.tsx
      [slug].tsx
    user/
      profile.tsx
      settings.tsx
  hooks/
    useAuth.ts
    useFetch.ts
  lib/
    api.ts
    utils.ts
  context/
    AuthContext.tsx
  styles/
    globals.css
```

### ✅ Use `index.ts`

Export files from an `index.ts` in each folder for clean imports:

```ts
// components/auth/index.ts
export { default as LoginForm } from "./LoginForm";
export { default as SignupForm } from "./SignupForm";
```

Now import like:

```ts
import { LoginForm, SignupForm } from "@/components/auth";
```

## 2. 🧩 Component Guidelines

* **Small & Focused:** Each component should do **one thing well**.
* **Reusability:** Extract shared logic/components instead of duplicating.
* **Naming Convention:**

  * Components → `PascalCase` (`UserCard.tsx`)
  * Hooks → `useCamelCase` (`useAuth.ts`)
  * Utilities → `camelCase` (`formatDate.ts`)
* **Single Responsibility:** A component should not handle multiple unrelated tasks.
* **Avoid God Components:** Break down large components into smaller ones.

---

## 3. ⚡ Code Quality & Style

* Follow **DRY** (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid).
* Use **TypeScript strictly** for type safety.
* Prefer **functional components + hooks** over class components.
* Avoid deeply nested code; refactor into smaller functions.
* Use **ESLint + Prettier** for consistency.

---

## 4. 🪝 Hooks & State Management

* Place custom hooks inside `/hooks`.
* Hooks must start with `use` (e.g., `useAuth`, `useDebounce`).
* Avoid putting all hooks in a single flat folder — group them by feature if possible.
* Use **context providers** for global state instead of prop drilling.

---

## 5. 📚 Library & Utility Management

* Keep **shared utilities** inside `lib/` or `utils/`.
* Split utils into small functions (e.g., `formatDate.ts`, `validateEmail.ts`).
* Don’t bloat utility files with unrelated functions.

---

## 6. 🧹 Cleanup & Maintenance

* Remove unused files like `page-old.tsx`, `component-new.tsx`, `backup.tsx`.
* Delete commented-out or dead code.
* Avoid duplicate files like `component2.tsx` → refactor into a reusable component.
* Remove experimental/test code before merging into main branch.

---

## 7. 🚀 Performance & Optimization

* Prefer **lazy loading** for heavy components/pages.
* Optimize images and static assets.
* Use **React.memo** and `useCallback` where necessary.
* Avoid unnecessary re-renders by proper state management.

---

## 8. 📖 Documentation & Comments

* Write **clear, concise comments** only where needed.
* Use **JSDoc/TSdoc** for complex functions.
* Keep `README.md` and `BEST_PRACTICES.md` updated.

---

## 9. ✅ Git & Workflow

* Use **meaningful commit messages** (e.g., `fix: login bug` instead of `update`).
* Keep PRs small and focused.
* Write **GitHub Issues** with clear task descriptions.

---

## 10. 🌱 Scaling & Long-Term Maintenance

* Always design with **scalability in mind**.
* Don’t create "dump folders" with 20–30 files. Use subfolders.
* Standardize patterns (naming, imports, structure).
* Run **code reviews** to enforce quality.

---

### 🎯 Goal:

A **clean, consistent, and scalable** codebase that is easy for any developer to understand, contribute to, and maintain in the long term.

Would you like me to also create a **short checklist version** (like a contributor quick reference) in addition to this long doc? That way devs can skim the checklist before coding.
