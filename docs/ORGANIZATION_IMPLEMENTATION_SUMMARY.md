## 📊 Database Structure

### New Tables

```
organizations
├── id, name, slug, description
├── plan (free, pro, team, enterprise)
├── maxMembers, maxProjects
└── settings (JSON)

organization_members
├── organizationId → organizations
├── userId → users
├── role (owner, admin, member, guest)
└── title, joinedAt, lastActiveAt

teams
├── organizationId → organizations
├── name, description
├── isDefault
└── settings (JSON)

team_members
├── teamId → teams
├── userId → users
├── role (lead, member)
└── addedAt

organization_invitations
├── organizationId → organizations
├── email, role
├── token (unique, for invitation link)
└── expiresAt, acceptedAt
```

### Updated Tables

- **projects**: Added `organizationId` and `teamId` columns

## 🔧 How to Use

### 1. Run the Migration

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

### 2. Access Organizations

- Navigate to `/organizations` to see all your organizations
- Click "New Organization" to create one
- Access organization settings via `/organizations/{id}/settings`

### 3. Invite Members

- Go to organization settings → Members tab
- Enter email and select role
- Send invitation
- Invitee receives a link: `/invite/{token}`

### 4. Create Teams

- Go to organization settings → Teams tab
- Enter team name and description
- Click "Create Team"

### 5. Use Organization Switcher

- Add `<OrganizationSwitcher />` to your navigation
- Switch between personal workspace and organizations

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Improvements Needed

1. **Email Integration**: Send actual invitation emails
2. **User Authentication**: Integrate with your auth system (currently uses x-user-id header)
3. **Organization Avatar Upload**: Implement file upload for organization logos
4. **Advanced Permissions**: Fine-grained permission system
5. **Activity Logs**: Track organization activities

## 📝 Usage Examples

import { createOrganization } from "@/lib/actions/organizations";

const result = await createOrganization(userId, {

  slug: "acme-inc",
  description: "Building the future",
});
```

## 🐛 Known Issues / TODO

1. ❗ TypeScript errors in API routes (missing type declarations) - These are compile-time only and won't affect runtime
2. ❗ Need to integrate with actual authentication system
3. ❗ Email notifications not implemented
4. ❗ File upload for avatars not implemented
5. ❗ Need to add loading states and error boundaries
6. ❗ Add pagination for large member/team lists
7. ❗ Implement optimistic updates for better UX
