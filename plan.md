# SketchFlow Development Plan

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Improvements âœ…
- [x] Replace fetch with useSWR across the application
- [x] Restructure DocsPanel file list to prevent overflow
- [x] Remove grid view and keep UI simple and minimal
- [x] Fix public project sharing functionality
- [x] Add embedding feature for shared URLs

## Phase 2: Enhanced Sharing & Public Access âœ…
- [x] Enable public access to documents via DocsPanel in shared/embed pages
- [x] Implement proper embed page with DocsPanel access
- [x] Fix project visibility updates when sharing publicly

## Phase 3: Canvas Library Integration ðŸ”„
- [x] Research Excalidraw libraries API (https://libraries.excalidraw.com/)
- [x] Add built-in library feature to canvas (similar to Eraser.io)
- [x] Integrate top 5 default libraries from Excalidraw
- [x] Implement library search and insertion functionality

## Phase 4: Document Editor Enhancements ðŸ”„
- [x] Enable manual save functionality in document editor
- [x] Add image upload feature to document editor (like Excalidraw)
- [x] Implement drag & drop image support
- [x] Add image management and optimization

## Phase 5: Code Quality & Organization âœ…
- [x] Run TypeScript checks (tsc --noEmit) before commits
- [x] Organize code structure and maintain consistency
- [x] Commit changes systematically without pushing
- [x] Update plan.md with progress tracking

## Future Features (Phase 6) - Not Implemented Yet
- [ ] Real-time collaboration features
- [ ] Multi-user editing support
- [ ] Live cursors and presence indicators
- [ ] Comment and annotation system
- [ ] Version history and branching
- [ ] Advanced permission management
- [ ] Team workspaces and organizations

## Technical Debt & Improvements
- [x] Replace all fetch calls with useSWR for better caching and revalidation
- [x] Implement proper error handling and loading states
- [x] Optimize component re-renders and data fetching
- [x] Standardize API response formats
- [x] Improve TypeScript type safety

## API Integrations
- [x] Excalidraw Libraries API integration
- [x] Image upload and storage optimization
- [x] Public sharing and embedding APIs
- [x] Real-time data synchronization with SWR

## UI/UX Improvements
- [x] Simplified and minimal design approach
- [x] Better responsive design for mobile devices
- [x] Improved loading states and error messages
- [x] Consistent component styling and behavior
- [x] Enhanced accessibility features

## Current Status: Phase 1-4 Complete âœ…
All core features have been implemented successfully. The application now has:
- SWR-based data fetching throughout
- Restructured DocsPanel with proper overflow handling
- Working public sharing and embedding
- Canvas library integration with Excalidraw libraries
- Enhanced document editor with save and image upload
- Proper TypeScript checking and organized commits

Ready for Phase 6 (Collaboration) when needed.

replace every fetch with useSWR and make the docspanel file list structured its overflowing and catch the filelist using swr and fetch and update data refresh in bg using swr (its default fetires in the lib) see docs online remove grid view from there and try to keep things simple and minimil across app -  afyter that fix the public making of project in share and add the embedding feture and in shared url and embed page users can also access the other docs using docspanel - after doing all - try to add support for lib feature in the canvas inbuilt in ui like erasor.io have and then in the document page the save button is disabled enable it to save tihngs manually and like the exculidraw have the features of image uploading add it to document editor also create a plan.md execute and update there and on every new feature addition commit a new changes run tsc -noemit check then commit dont push be organised - and one more thing fetch - https://libraries.excalidraw.com/ and the apis docs request and add top 5 libraries by default in the library of canvas and in the plan.md also list to add colaboration fetures (dont add now we will add later)
