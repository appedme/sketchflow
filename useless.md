🗑️ Files That Can Be Deleted
Backup/Unused Files:
src/app/try/page.tsx.bk - Backup file with old Excalidraw implementation
src/components/ui/tweet-grid-demo.tsx - Demo file not referenced anywhere
src/lib/utils/test-id-generator.ts - Test utility not used in production
Empty Directories:
src/context/ - Empty directory
src/lib/hooks/ - Empty directory
src/components/error-boundary/ - Empty directory
Debug/Development Files:
src/components/debug/ViewTrackingTest.tsx - Debug component not used in production
🔧 Unused Dependencies (Can be removed from package.json)
Potentially Unused:
@faker-js/faker - Only used in editor plugins for demo data
react-lite-youtube-embed - No references found
react-player - No references found
remark-gfm - No references found
remark-math - No references found
use-file-picker - No references found
unique-names-generator - No references found
tw-animate-css - No references found in devDependencies
📦 Unused Imports & Code
CSS Files:
src/components/ui/tweet-grid.css - Only used by tweet-grid component
src/styles/project-card.css - Only used by ProjectCard component
src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.css - Check if actually used
src/components/dashboard/ProjectCard.css - Only used by ProjectCard
Duplicate/Redundant Files:
src/stack.ts - Duplicate of src/lib/stack.ts functionality
src/instrumentation.js vs instrumentation.ts - Both exist, keep only one
🚀 API Routes Analysis
Admin Routes (Consider access control):
src/app/api/admin/* - Ensure these are properly secured
src/app/api/ai/pollinations-test/ - Test endpoint, consider removing in production
Potentially Unused API Routes:
src/app/api/templates/route.ts - Check if template system is fully implemented
src/app/api/projects/stats/ - Verify if project stats are being used
🎯 Optimization Recommendations
1. Remove Unused Files:
# Delete these files
rm src/app/try/page.tsx.bk
rm src/components/ui/tweet-grid-demo.tsx
rm src/lib/utils/test-id-generator.ts
rm -rf src/context
rm -rf src/lib/hooks
rm -rf src/components/error-boundary
rm src/components/debug/ViewTrackingTest.tsx
2. Clean up package.json:
Remove these dependencies if confirmed unused:

{
  "dependencies": {
    // Remove these if not used:
    "@faker-js/faker": "^9.9.0",
    "react-lite-youtube-embed": "^2.5.1",
    "react-player": "^3.2.0",
    "remark-gfm": "^4.0.1",
    "remark-math": "^6.0.0",
    "use-file-picker": "^2.1.2",
    "unique-names-generator": "^4.7.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    // Remove if not used:
    "tw-animate-css": "^1.3.5"
  }
}
3. Consolidate Stack Configuration:
Keep src/lib/stack.ts and remove src/stack.ts
Update imports to use src/lib/stack.ts
4. Bundle Size Optimization:
Your Next.js config already has good optimizations, but consider:

Lazy loading more components
Code splitting for heavy libraries like Excalidraw and Plate.js
Remove unused Radix UI components
5. Import Optimization:
Many files import entire libraries when only specific functions are needed. Consider tree-shaking optimizations.

📊 Impact Assessment
Estimated Bundle Size Reduction: ~15-25%

Removing unused dependencies: ~10-15%
Removing unused files: ~5-10%
Import optimization: ~5%
Files to Review Further:

Check if all Plate.js plugins in src/components/editor/ are actually used
Verify all Radix UI components in src/components/ui/ are needed
Review if all MagicUI components are being used
Would you like me to help you implement any of these optimizations or need me to analyze specific areas in more detail?
