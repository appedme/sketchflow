4. Run database migrations: `npm run db:push`
5. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`

### Making Changes

1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`

3. Test your changes thoroughly
4. Run linting: `npm run lint`
5. Commit your changes using conventional commits:
   ```
   feat: add new feature
