# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the broken document functionality in the SketchFlow project. Currently, the PlateJS editor works in isolation on the `/editor` page, but the document creation, editing, and management within projects is non-functional due to missing API routes and broken frontend integration. This feature will fix all document-related functionality to enable users to create, edit, and manage rich-text documents within their projects using the PlateJS editor.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project owner, I want to create new documents within my projects, so that I can add rich-text content alongside my canvases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "New Document" in the documentation panel THEN the system SHALL create a new document with default PlateJS content
2. WHEN a new document is created THEN the system SHALL redirect me to the document editor page
3. WHEN creating a document THEN the system SHALL validate that I have edit permissions on the project
4. IF I don't have edit permissions THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent document creation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project collaborator, I want to edit documents using a rich-text editor, so that I can create well-formatted content with various text styles and elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open a document THEN the system SHALL display the PlateJS editor with the document's current content
2. WHEN I make changes to the document THEN the system SHALL auto-save the changes every 2 seconds
3. WHEN I edit a document THEN the system SHALL preserve all PlateJS formatting including headings, lists, links, and other rich content
4. WHEN I save a document THEN the system SHALL update both the JSON content and searchable text content in the database
5. IF I don't have edit permissions THEN the system SHALL display the document in read-only mode

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project member, I want to view a list of all documents in a project, so that I can easily navigate between different documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the documentation panel THEN the system SHALL display all documents in the current project
2. WHEN I click on a document in the list THEN the system SHALL navigate to that document's editor page
3. WHEN viewing the document list THEN the system SHALL show document titles, last updated time, and content preview
4. WHEN documents are updated THEN the system SHALL refresh the document list automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project owner, I want to rename and delete documents, so that I can organize my project content effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the edit button on a document THEN the system SHALL allow me to rename the document inline
2. WHEN I save a new document name THEN the system SHALL update the document title in the database
3. WHEN I delete a document THEN the system SHALL remove it from the project and update the document list
4. WHEN I attempt to delete a document THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog
5. IF I don't have edit permissions THEN the system SHALL hide rename and delete options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project collaborator, I want the document editor to integrate seamlessly with the project workspace, so that I can switch between documents and canvases easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I'm in a document editor THEN the system SHALL show project navigation and toolbar
2. WHEN I'm editing a document THEN the system SHALL provide options to open in split view with a canvas
3. WHEN I navigate between documents THEN the system SHALL preserve unsaved changes with auto-save
4. WHEN I access a document via direct URL THEN the system SHALL load the document within the project context

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project member, I want to search through document content, so that I can quickly find specific information across all project documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type in the search box THEN the system SHALL filter documents by title and content text
2. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight matching documents in the list
3. WHEN I clear the search THEN the system SHALL show all documents again
4. WHEN documents are updated THEN the system SHALL update the searchable text content for future searches
