and impliment emoji search and picker like slack and notion and add it to the canvas and document editor like if the hex code is 1F600 then the url will be https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hfg-gmuend/openmoji@master/color/svg/1F600.svg and https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hfg-gmuend/openmoji@master/black/svg/1F600.svg (for dark mode) so you can use next/image for it and add a search bar to search emojis by their name and keywords and show them in a grid view with infinite scroll and on click of any emoji it should be added to the canvas or document at the cursor position

you are free to use context7 mcp to get docs of excualidraw and platejs for document editor
