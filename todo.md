add optimistic update and loading state to docspanel its take 2 minutes if I rename the file name or create new doc or canvas to showup in the docs panel it must be quick even before the api call is done like the like button on social media it should be quick and optimistic update

and if you are adding signin then redirect after login using the url format http://localhost:3000/handler/sign-in?after_auth_return_to=%2F


add embed feature easy simple and working

fast optimistic data showing in canvas and document while navigating between files using docs panel


count views for each file in the docs panel and the project page





r2 ui like aws ui


branwash ai instead of finetune ai
