## 🚀 Performance Improvements

- **Bundle Size**: Reduced by removing unused dependencies and code
- **Load Time**: Faster with optimized lazy loading and caching
- **Memory Usage**: Smart cache management with automatic cleanup
- **Re-renders**: Minimized with proper memoization and selectors
- **Developer Experience**: Clean imports and organized structure

## 📋 Best Practices Implemented

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
2. **DRY Principle**: Eliminated code duplication
3. **KISS Principle**: Simplified complex components
4. **Clean Imports**: Barrel exports for organized imports
5. **Performance First**: Optimized for speed and efficiency
6. **Maintainability**: Clear structure and naming conventions

## 🎉 Results

The codebase is now:
- ✅ **Clean and organized** with feature-based structure
